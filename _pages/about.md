Self-directed and motivated PhD Student from ANU Centre for Gravitational Astrophysics with research background of photonics sensing and laser stabilization. Involved in multiple research projects, including cavity enhanced spectroscopy and fibre array sensing. Having a broad knowledge in applied optics, from physics point of view (including free space optics, optical resonator, fibre, lasers, etc) to engineering prototyping (from software programming to hardware analog design). Demonstrated ability to work in a challenging and fast-paced environment. Having two years of experience in a start-up company working on industrial projects and volume production, especially in charge of hardware design and associated QA/QC test development. Recognized as a strong collaborator with ability of efficient communication with third-party manufacturers (domestic and international). Skilled at multiple programming languages and interested in learning state-of-the-art techniques (such as machine learning algorithms) and utilizing it to solve problems in different projects.
